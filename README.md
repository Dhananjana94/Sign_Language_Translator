INTRODUCTION  According to universal opinion hearing impairment, deafness, or hearing loss refer to the total or partial inability to hear sound. Considering symptoms, it can be mild, moderate, severe, or profound (Deafness and hearing loss: Causes, symptoms, and treatments, 2021.). In view of all these patients' mild hearing, people may have understanding speech.If there are big noise around. Therefore, without a specialized mechanism, they have difficulty to communicating. Not only the deaf people dumb person also faces this communication problem since all the deaf and dumb people do not use sign language in their day to day life, for ease of recognition we define the term as deaf including any person who communicates using sign language but some hearing person use both audible and the sign language but actually sign language introduce for deaf and the dumb person (Gayathri &amp; Sasi, 2019). To overcome that difficulty Sign language was introduced in the 17th century in western society as a visual language (Wikipedia, n.d.). Even if deaf people can communicate using sign language they cannot communicate with nondisabled people. Therefore, some mechanisms need to communicate with them because there is not any perfect mechanism to contact them.
